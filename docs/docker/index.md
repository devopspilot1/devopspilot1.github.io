# Docker

Docker helps you package applications with all their dependencies and run them consistently across environments — from local development to production.

This section is designed as a **practical Docker learning path**, starting from core concepts and moving toward real-world usage.

---

## 🧱 Docker Fundamentals

Understand why Docker exists and how it solves dependency and environment issues.

* **What is Docker**
* **Physical Server → VM → Containers**
* **Docker Images vs Containers**
* **How Docker fits into CI/CD workflows**

---

## ⚙️ Docker Installation & Setup

Set up Docker correctly before building or running containers.

* Install Docker on Linux
* Verify Docker installation
* Basic Docker CLI usage

---

## 📦 Working with Docker Images

Learn how images are created, tagged, stored, and shared.

* Pull images from Docker Hub
* Build custom images
* Tag and manage images
* Push images to public and private repositories

---

## 🧩 Dockerfile Essentials

Create reproducible and optimized Docker images.

* Writing basic Dockerfiles
* Installing packages using Dockerfile
* Multi-stage Docker builds
* Running Java applications in containers

---

## 🚀 Running Containers

Understand container lifecycle and runtime behavior.

* Running containers
* Port mapping
* Logs and container inspection
* Resource usage (CPU / Memory)

---

## 🔄 Docker in Real Projects

Apply Docker in real-world DevOps scenarios.

* Containerizing web applications
* Using Docker with Jenkins pipelines
