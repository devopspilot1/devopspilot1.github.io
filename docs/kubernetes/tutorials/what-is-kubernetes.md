# What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Container Orchestration
- Manages multiple containers across multiple hosts
- Ensures high availability and scalability
- Handles container lifecycle management

### 2. Core Features
- **Automated rollouts and rollbacks**
- **Service discovery and load balancing**
- **Storage orchestration**
- **Self-healing**
- **Secret and configuration management**
- **Horizontal scaling**

### 3. Basic Architecture

#### Control Plane Components
1. **kube-apiserver**: Frontend for Kubernetes control plane
2. **etcd**: Key-value store for all cluster data
3. **kube-scheduler**: Watches for newly created pods and assigns them to nodes
4. **kube-controller-manager**: Runs controller processes

#### Node Components
1. **kubelet**: Ensures containers are running in a Pod
2. **kube-proxy**: Maintains network rules on nodes
3. **Container runtime**: Software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker)

### 4. Basic Objects
- **Pods**: Smallest deployable units
- **Services**: Expose applications running on pods
- **Volumes**: Persistent storage
- **Namespaces**: Virtual clusters

## Why Use Kubernetes?

1. **Portability**
   - Run applications anywhere (cloud, on-premises)
   - Consistent environment across development and production

2. **Scalability**
   - Automatically scale applications based on demand
   - Handle increased traffic efficiently

3. **High Availability**
   - Self-healing capabilities
   - Automatic rollouts and rollbacks
   - Load balancing

4. **Container Management**
   - Automated container deployment
   - Resource optimization
   - Service discovery and load balancing

## Real-World Example

Let's consider a simple web application:

```yaml
# Simple web application deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web-container
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

This example shows:
- Deployment of a web application
- Running 3 replicas for high availability
- Using nginx as the web server
- Exposing port 80

## Benefits in Practice

1. **Development**
   - Consistent development environment
   - Easy testing and deployment
   - Quick rollback if needed

2. **Operations**
   - Automated scaling
   - Self-healing capabilities
   - Easy monitoring and logging

3. **Business**
   - Reduced downtime
   - Better resource utilization
   - Cost efficiency

## Getting Started

To start with Kubernetes:
1. Install a local Kubernetes cluster (Minikube)
2. Learn basic kubectl commands
3. Deploy your first application
4. Explore more advanced features
