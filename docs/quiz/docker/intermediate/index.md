← [Back to Quiz Home](../../index.md)

Welcome! 🐳  
Test your knowledge on Docker networking, volumes, and composition.

**Instructions**:

*   Select the best answer for each question.
*   Your score will be shown at the end.

<quiz>
Which command is used to show container logs?
- [x] docker logs [container_id]
- [ ] docker show [container_id]
- [ ] docker output [container_id]
- [ ] docker print [container_id]

`docker logs` fetches the logs of a container.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is a Docker Volume used for?
- [x] Persisting data outside the container's lifecycle
- [ ] Increasing container speed
- [ ] Networking between containers
- [ ] Reducing image size

Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which command is used to launch a multi-container application defined in a YAML file?
- [x] docker-compose up
- [ ] docker run -all
- [ ] docker start --compose
- [ ] docker-stack deploy

`docker-compose up` builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service defined in a `docker-compose.yml`.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which Docker network driver is the default for containers?
- [x] bridge
- [ ] host
- [ ] overlay
- [ ] none

`bridge` is the default network driver. If you don't specify a driver, this is the type of network you are building.
</quiz>

<quiz>
How do you execute a command inside a running container?
- [x] docker exec -it [container_id] [command]
- [ ] docker run -it [container_id] [command]
- [ ] docker enter [container_id]
- [ ] docker attach [container_id]

`docker exec` runs a new command in a running container. `-it` allows interactive access.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which command removes an image?
- [x] docker rmi
- [ ] docker rm
- [ ] docker delete image
- [ ] docker prune image

`docker rmi` (or `docker image rm`) removes one or more images.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is the purpose of `.dockerignore` file?
- [x] To exclude files/directories from the build context
- [ ] To ignore errors during build
- [ ] To hide passwords
- [ ] To ignore docker commands

It excludes files and directories from the build context, similar to `.gitignore`.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which flag maps a port from the container to the host?
- [x] -p
- [ ] -P
- [ ] -port
- [ ] --map

`-p` (e.g., `-p 8080:80`) maps a Host port to a Container port.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is a dangling image?
- [x] An image layer that has no relationship to any tagged image
- [ ] A corrupt image
- [ ] A stopped container
- [ ] An image from a private registry

Dangling images are untagged images, often intermediate layers from old builds, displayed as `<none>`.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which command creates a new volume?
- [x] docker volume create
- [ ] docker create volume
- [ ] docker add volume
- [ ] docker new volume

    `docker volume create` manually creates a named volume.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which command builds an image from a Dockerfile in the current directory?
- [x] docker build -t my-image .
- [ ] docker create -t my-image .
- [ ] docker make -t my-image .
- [ ] docker compile -t my-image .

`docker build` builds an image from a Dockerfile. The `.` specifies the build context (current directory).
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is the default name of the Docker configuration file that defines a multi-container application?
- [x] docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Dockerfile
- [ ] compose.json
- [ ] docker-config.yaml

`docker-compose.yml` is the default file used by Docker Compose.
</quiz>

<quiz>
In Docker Compose, which keyword defines the dependencies between services?
- [x] depends_on
- [ ] links
- [ ] requires
- [ ] after

`depends_on` expresses dependency order (start order).
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which network driver creates a distributed network among multiple Docker daemon hosts?
- [x] overlay
- [ ] bridge
- [ ] host
- [ ] macvlan

The `overlay` network driver creates a distributed network among multiple Docker daemon hosts.
</quiz>

<quiz>
How can you isolate a container from the host network stack?
- [x] By default, it is isolated (bridge mode)
- [ ] Use --network host
- [ ] Use --isolation=hyperv
- [ ] It's not possible

Containers are isolated by default using the bridge driver.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What command lists all networks?
- [x] docker network ls
- [ ] docker list networks
- [ ] docker network show
- [ ] docker net list

`docker network ls` lists all networks.
</quiz>

<quiz>
How do you inspect a specific network?
- [x] docker network inspect [network-name]
- [ ] docker inspect network [network-name]
- [ ] docker show network [network-name]
- [ ] docker network details [network-name]

`docker network inspect` provides detailed information about a network.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which command removes all unused networks?
- [x] docker network prune
- [ ] docker network clean
- [ ] docker rm networks
- [ ] docker clean networks

`docker network prune` removes all networks not used by at least one container.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is a Bind Mount?
- [x] A file or directory on the host machine mounted into a container
- [ ] A managed volume
- [ ] A cloud storage mount
- [ ] A temporary file system

Bind mounts map a host file or directory to a container path.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which instruction in Dockerfile is used to copy files from the context to the image?
- [x] COPY
- [ ] LOAD
- [ ] MOVE
- [ ] PASTE

`COPY` copies new files or directories from `<src>` and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path `<dest>`.
