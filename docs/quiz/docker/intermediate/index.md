Welcome! 🐳  
Test your knowledge on Docker networking, volumes, and composition.

**Instructions**:
*   Select the best answer for each question.
*   Your score will be shown at the end.

<quiz>
Which command is used to show container logs?
- [x] docker logs [container_id]
- [ ] docker show [container_id]
- [ ] docker output [container_id]
- [ ] docker print [container_id]

`docker logs` fetches the logs of a container.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is a Docker Volume used for?
- [x] Persisting data outside the container's lifecycle
- [ ] Increasing container speed
- [ ] Networking between containers
- [ ] Reducing image size

Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which command is used to launch a multi-container application defined in a YAML file?
- [x] docker-compose up
- [ ] docker run -all
- [ ] docker start --compose
- [ ] docker-stack deploy

`docker-compose up` builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service defined in a `docker-compose.yml`.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which Docker network driver is the default for containers?
- [x] bridge
- [ ] host
- [ ] overlay
- [ ] none

`bridge` is the default network driver. If you don't specify a driver, this is the type of network you are building.
</quiz>

<quiz>
How do you execute a command inside a running container?
- [x] docker exec -it [container_id] [command]
- [ ] docker run -it [container_id] [command]
- [ ] docker enter [container_id]
- [ ] docker attach [container_id]

`docker exec` runs a new command in a running container. `-it` allows interactive access.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which command removes an image?
- [x] docker rmi
- [ ] docker rm
- [ ] docker delete image
- [ ] docker prune image

`docker rmi` (or `docker image rm`) removes one or more images.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is the purpose of `.dockerignore` file?
- [x] To exclude files/directories from the build context
- [ ] To ignore errors during build
- [ ] To hide passwords
- [ ] To ignore docker commands

It excludes files and directories from the build context, similar to `.gitignore`.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which flag maps a port from the container to the host?
- [x] -p
- [ ] -P
- [ ] -port
- [ ] --map

`-p` (e.g., `-p 8080:80`) maps a Host port to a Container port.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is a dangling image?
- [x] An image layer that has no relationship to any tagged image
- [ ] A corrupt image
- [ ] A stopped container
- [ ] An image from a private registry

Dangling images are untagged images, often intermediate layers from old builds, displayed as `<none>`.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which command creates a new volume?
- [x] docker volume create
- [ ] docker create volume
- [ ] docker add volume
- [ ] docker new volume

`docker volume create` manually creates a named volume.
