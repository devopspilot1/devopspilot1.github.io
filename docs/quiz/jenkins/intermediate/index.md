← [Back to Quiz Home](../../index.md)

Welcome! 🤵‍♂️  
Test your knowledge on Pipelines, Agents, and Artifacts.

**Instructions**:
*   Select the best answer for each question.
*   Your score will be shown at the end.

<quiz>
What are the two syntaxes for Jenkins Pipelines?
- [x] Declarative and Scripted
- [ ] YAML and JSON
- [ ] XML and HTML
- [ ] Bash and Python

Pipelines can be written in Declarative syntax (easier, more structured) or Scripted syntax (Groovy-based, more flexible).
</quiz>

<quiz>
In a Jenkinsfile, which block contains the actual work?
- [x] steps
- [ ] task
- [ ] job
- [ ] run

Inside a `stage`, the `steps` block contains the actual commands to execute.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is the purpose of the `archiveArtifacts` step?
- [x] To save files generated by the build for later use
- [ ] To delete old builds
- [ ] To compress the source code
- [ ] To upload files to Git

`archiveArtifacts` captures files (like JARs, WARs, reports) produced by the build so they can be downloaded from the Jenkins UI.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which cron syntax means "Run every 15 minutes"?
- [x] H/15 * * * *
- [ ] 15 * * * *
- [ ] * * * * 15
- [ ] 15 15 15 15 15

`H/15 * * * *` runs the job every 15 minutes. 'H' is used to spread load (hash).
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is a "Shared Library" in Jenkins?
- [x] A reusable collection of Groovy scripts for Pipelines
- [ ] A plugin for libraries
- [ ] A folder for jar files
- [ ] A backup system

Shared Libraries allow you to define common logic in external Git repositories and load them into your Pipelines.
</quiz>

<quiz>
How do you define a parameter in a Declarative Pipeline?
- [x] parameters { string(...) }
- [ ] inputs { text(...) }
- [ ] args { var(...) }
- [ ] vars { string(...) }

The `parameters` directive is used to define build parameters.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What does the `post` section in a Pipeline do?
- [x] Defines actions to run after the pipeline or a stage completes
- [ ] Defines pre-build steps
- [ ] Sends HTTP posts
- [ ] Authenticates users

The `post` section handles conditions like `always`, `success`, `failure`, `changed` to run cleanups or notifications.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which directive is used to specify where the pipeline runs?
- [x] agent
- [ ] node
- [ ] runner
- [ ] machine

`agent` specifies the execution point. `agent any` runs on any available agent.
</quiz>

<quiz>
How can you safely use secrets (like passwords) in a Pipeline?
- [x] Use the Credentials Binding plugin (`withCredentials`)
- [ ] Hardcode them in the Jenkinsfile
- [ ] Write them in a text file
- [ ] Pass them as plain parameters

You should store secrets in Jenkins Credentials and access them using `withCredentials` or `credentials()` helper.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is "Jenkins Configuration as Code" (JCasC)?
- [x] Managing Jenkins master configuration via YAML files
- [ ] Writing plugins in C++
- [ ] Using Docker for agents
- [ ] Writing Pipelines

JCasC allows defining the configuration of the Jenkins controller in a YAML file for reproducible setups.
