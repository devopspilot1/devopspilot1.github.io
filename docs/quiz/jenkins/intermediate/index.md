# Jenkins Intermediate Quiz

← [Back to Quiz Home](../../index.md)

Welcome! 🤵‍♂️  
Test your knowledge on Pipelines, Agents, and Artifacts.

**Instructions**:

*   Select the best answer for each question.
*   Your score will be shown at the end.

<quiz>
What are the two syntaxes for Jenkins Pipelines?
- [x] Declarative and Scripted
- [ ] YAML and JSON
- [ ] XML and HTML
- [ ] Bash and Python

Pipelines can be written in Declarative syntax (easier, more structured) or Scripted syntax (Groovy-based, more flexible).
</quiz>

<quiz>
In a Jenkinsfile, which block contains the actual work?
- [x] steps
- [ ] task
- [ ] job
- [ ] run

Inside a `stage`, the `steps` block contains the actual commands to execute.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is the purpose of the `archiveArtifacts` step?
- [x] To save files generated by the build for later use
- [ ] To delete old builds
- [ ] To compress the source code
- [ ] To upload files to Git

`archiveArtifacts` captures files (like JARs, WARs, reports) produced by the build so they can be downloaded from the Jenkins UI.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which cron syntax means "Run every 15 minutes"?
- [x] H/15 * * * *
- [ ] 15 * * * *
- [ ] * * * * 15
- [ ] 15 15 15 15 15

`H/15 * * * *` runs the job every 15 minutes. 'H' is used to spread load (hash).
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is a "Shared Library" in Jenkins?
- [x] A reusable collection of Groovy scripts for Pipelines
- [ ] A plugin for libraries
- [ ] A folder for jar files
- [ ] A backup system

Shared Libraries allow you to define common logic in external Git repositories and load them into your Pipelines.
</quiz>

<quiz>
How do you define a parameter in a Declarative Pipeline?
- [x] parameters { string(...) }
- [ ] inputs { text(...) }
- [ ] args { var(...) }
- [ ] vars { string(...) }

The `parameters` directive is used to define build parameters.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What does the `post` section in a Pipeline do?
- [x] Defines actions to run after the pipeline or a stage completes
- [ ] Defines pre-build steps
- [ ] Sends HTTP posts
- [ ] Authenticates users

The `post` section handles conditions like `always`, `success`, `failure`, `changed` to run cleanups or notifications.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which directive is used to specify where the pipeline runs?
- [x] agent
- [ ] node
- [ ] runner
- [ ] machine

`agent` specifies the execution point. `agent any` runs on any available agent.
</quiz>

<quiz>
How can you safely use secrets (like passwords) in a Pipeline?
- [x] Use the Credentials Binding plugin (`withCredentials`)
- [ ] Hardcode them in the Jenkinsfile
- [ ] Write them in a text file
- [ ] Pass them as plain parameters

You should store secrets in Jenkins Credentials and access them using `withCredentials` or `credentials()` helper.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is "Jenkins Configuration as Code" (JCasC)?
- [x] Managing Jenkins master configuration via YAML files
- [ ] Writing plugins in C++
- [ ] Using Docker for agents
- [ ] Writing Pipelines

JCasC allows defining the configuration of the Jenkins controller in a YAML file for reproducible setups.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is the `parallel` directive used for?
- [x] To execute stages concurrently
- [ ] To run on multiple agents
- [ ] To duplicate the pipeline
- [ ] To split the screen

The `parallel` directive allows you to define a list of stages to run in parallel.
</quiz>

<quiz>
How do you access Environment Variables in a Pipeline?
- [x] ${env.VARIABLE_NAME}
- [ ] $VARIABLE_NAME
- [ ] %VARIABLE_NAME%
- [ ] {{ VARIABLE_NAME }}

Use `${env.VAR_NAME}` or simply `env.VAR_NAME` to access environment variables.
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which step allows you to pause the pipeline for user approval?
- [x] input
- [ ] wait
- [ ] pause
- [ ] approve

The `input` step pauses execution until a user manually approves or aborts.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is the `when` directive used for?
- [x] To conditionally execute a stage
- [ ] To loop a stage
- [ ] To define a timestamp
- [ ] To schedule the pipeline

`when` allows you to control whether a stage should be run depending on criteria (e.g., branch name, environment variable).
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is a Multibranch Pipeline?
- [x] A pipeline that automatically creates jobs for each branch in a repo
- [ ] A pipeline with multiple git repos
- [ ] A pipeline that merges branches
- [ ] A pipeline for master branch only

It scans the SCM repository for branches and creates a Pipeline job for each branch containing a Jenkinsfile.
</quiz>

<quiz>
How do you discard old builds automatically?
- [x] Using `options { buildDiscarder(...) }`
- [ ] Manually deleting them
- [ ] Using a cron job
- [ ] Restarting Jenkins

The `buildDiscarder` option allows you to configure log rotation (e.g., keep last 5 builds).
</quiz>

<quiz>
Which file works as an ignore list for the SCM checkout?
- [x] .gitignore
- [ ] .jenkinsignore
- [ ] .scmingnore
- [ ] .dockerignore

Jenkins respects `.gitignore` during the checkout process if standard Git behavior is used, effectively ignoring files from being tracked.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is the `stash` step used for?
- [x] To save files for use later in the same build (e.g., on another node)
- [ ] To save artifacts permanently
- [ ] To hide files
- [ ] To encrypt files

`stash` saves a set of files for use later in the same build, often to transfer workspace content between different agents.
</quiz>

<quiz>
How do you set a timeout for a stage?
- [x] options { timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS') }
- [ ] timeout 1h
- [ ] wait { 1 hour }
- [ ] limit 1h

The `timeout` option aborts the stage/pipeline if it takes longer than the specified time.
</quiz>

<quiz>
What is the `retry` option used for?
- [x] To retry the block/stage a specified number of times on failure
- [ ] To restart the controller
- [ ] To retry the connection
- [ ] To rollback

`retry(3)` will retry the enclosed steps up to 3 times if they fail.
