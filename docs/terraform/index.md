# Terraform – Infrastructure as Code with Real Cloud Projects 🏗️

Terraform allows you to **provision and manage cloud infrastructure using code**.
On DevopsPilot, Terraform is taught using **real AWS and GCP projects**, not abstract examples.

This section focuses on **practical, end-to-end infrastructure automation**.

---

## 🔰 What You’ll Learn Here

✔ How Terraform works in real cloud environments
✔ Writing Terraform for **AWS and GCP services**
✔ Managing CI/CD infrastructure using Terraform
✔ Project-based learning with reusable code

---

## 🧠 How Terraform Is Used on DevopsPilot

Instead of isolated concepts, Terraform is covered through:

* Real AWS services (CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline)
* Real GCP services (Cloud Run, Apigee)
* End-to-end infrastructure workflows
* GitHub-backed Terraform projects

> 💡 Learn Terraform the same way it’s used in real DevOps teams.
