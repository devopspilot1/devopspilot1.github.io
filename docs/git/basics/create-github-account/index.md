## 🤔 What is Git?

**Git** stands for **Global Information Tracker**.

It is a powerful distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development.

### Git Architecture

The core model of Git involves **Pull** and **Push** operations:

1. **Developer 1** creates `file-1` locally and **pushes** it to the **Remote Repository**.
2. **Developer 2** and **Developer 3** can **pull** `file-1` to their local machines.
3. If **Developer 3** creates `file-3` and pushes it, others can pull it too.
