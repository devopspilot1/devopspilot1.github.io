# Jenkins Pipelines

Welcome to the **Jenkins Pipelines** section! 🚀

This section focuses on the heart of modern Jenkins: **Pipelines**. Here you will find practical, real-world examples of `Jenkinsfile` scripts for various use cases.

## 💡 Why Pipelines?
Pipelines allow you to define your entire build process as code (`Jenkinsfile`), making it versionable, reviewable, and durable.

## 📂 What's Inside?

We provide ready-to-use pipeline examples for:

*   **Java & Maven**: Building, testing, and deploying Java applications.
*   **Docker**: Building Docker images, tagging them, and pushing to registries (Docker Hub, Artifactory).
*   **Tomcat Deployment**: Automating deployments to Tomcat servers across different environments (Dev, QA, Prod).
*   **Conditional Logic**: using `when` conditions to run stages only when specific criteria are met.
*   **Environment Variables**: Managing credentials and environment-specific configurations securely.

## 🛠 How to Use These Examples
1.  **Copy the Jenkinsfile**: detailed explanations are provided for each block.
2.  **Customize**: Adapt the variables (repo URLs, credentials IDs) to your environment.
3.  **Run**: Create a "Pipeline" job in Jenkins and paste the script (or load it from SCM).
