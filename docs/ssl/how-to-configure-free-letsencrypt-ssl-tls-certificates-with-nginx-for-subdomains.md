title: "How to configure free single Let’s Encrypt SSL/TLS Certificate with NGINX for multiple subdomains and auto renew certificate"

---

### Prerequisites

- Have NGINX or NGINX Plus installed.

- Own or control the registered domain name for the certificate.

- Create a DNS record that associates your domain name and your server’s public IP address.

### What is certbot

Certbot is a agent for letsencrypt that runs in a server to complete the letsencrypt challenge, request a certificate and get a certificate.

### What is Letsencrypt challenge

Letsencrypt want to verify that you own the domain. So using certbot it will host some files in `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` folder and serve this files publicly using nginx webserver.

Once it verifies the files, the challenge is completed and it will issue the certificate for the requested domain.

### How to install cerbot

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot
sudo apt-get install python3-certbot-nginx
```

### Create some sample application

To test multiple subdomains, we need some sample applications. Lets create 3 docker containers with sample python flask application.

```
docker run -d -e APP_COLOR=red -p 8081:5000 vigneshsweekaran/helloworld-flask:latest
docker run -d -e APP_COLOR=green -p 8082:5000 vigneshsweekaran/helloworld-flask:latest
docker run -d -e APP_COLOR=blue -p 8083:5000 vigneshsweekaran/helloworld-flask:latest
```

Now we created 3 docker containers which runs on port 8081,8082 and 8083

Now open the browser and verify the applications are running.

IP-address:8081 --> Should show background color as red

IP-address:8082 --> Should show background color as green

IP-address:8083 --> Should show background color as blue

### Configure DNS record in Domain registrar

app1.devopspilot.tk --> Public IP-address

app2.devopspilot.tk --> Public IP-address

app3.devopspilot.tk --> Public IP-address

![letsencrypt](../images/dns-record.png)

`Note :`

- Public IP-address --> Public IP-address of your server, where 3 docker containers are running.

- Make sure ports 8081, 8082 and 8083 are open.

- Replace devopspilot.tk with your domain name.

### Configure Nginx

Remove the default configuration file in nginx

```
sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Create new config file `devopspilot.tk.conf` in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` folder and put the following content

`Info:` Configuration file name can be anything

```
sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/devopspilot.tk.conf
```

Replace `devopspilot.tk` with your domain name in config file

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name app1.devopspilot.tk;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8081;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name app2.devopspilot.tk;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8082;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name app3.devopspilot.tk;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8083;
    }
}
```

Run the following command to check for syntax error in conf file

```
sudo nginx -t
```

`Output :`

```
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

Run the following command to reload the nginx webserver

```
nginx -s reload
```

Now open the browser and verify whether applications are mapped to subdomains.

app1.devopspilot.tk --> Should show background color as red

app2.devopspilot.tk --> Should show background color as green

app3.devopspilot.tk --> Should show background color as blue

Change the `devopspilot.tk` to your domain name and run the below command.

It will complete the letsencrpt challenge, generate the certificate and map the certificate path in `devopspilot.tk.conf` conf file

```
sudo certbot --nginx -d app1.devopspilot.tk -d app2.devopspilot.tk -d app3.devopspilot.tk
```

It will ask for email address, agree the terms and conditions, certificate will be issued and finally enter `2` to automatically redirect `http` to `https`

Check the nginx conf file `/etc/nginx/conf.d/devopspilot.tk.conf` which was updated by certbot

Now the nginx conf file looks like below.

```
server {
    server_name app1.devopspilot.tk;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8081;
    }
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/app1.devopspilot.tk/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/app1.devopspilot.tk/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
}
server {
    server_name app2.devopspilot.tk;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8082;
    }
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/app1.devopspilot.tk/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/app1.devopspilot.tk/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
}
server {
    server_name app3.devopspilot.tk;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8083;
    }
    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/app1.devopspilot.tk/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/app1.devopspilot.tk/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
}
server {
    if ($host = app1.devopspilot.tk) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot
    listen 80;
    server_name app1.devopspilot.tk;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot
}
server {
    if ($host = app2.devopspilot.tk) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot
    listen 80;
    server_name app2.devopspilot.tk;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot
}
server {
    if ($host = app3.devopspilot.tk) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot
    listen 80;
    server_name app3.devopspilot.tk;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot
}
```

Wait for couple of minutes.

Go to browser and type the domain name and verify whether its changed to `https`

Go to browser and type `http://app1.devopspilot.tk`

Now it will automatically redirect to `https://app1.devopspilot.tk`

Now lets see how to automatically renew the certificates.

Letsencrypt certificates will expire after 3 months.

Create a cron job with `certbot renew` command. This job will daily run at 12 AM and check whether certificates are going to expire or not.

If it is going to expire it will regenerate the certificate and map the new certificate path in nginx conf file

Run the following command to create a cron job.

```
crontab -e
```

After running the `crontab -e` command it will open a file, type the below command and save the file.

```
0 12 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet
```

Hurray! we have successfully configured the SSL/TLS certificate in nginx webserver.
